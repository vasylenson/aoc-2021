# Advent of Code 2021

My first time doing Aoc, while also trying to code in Rust for the first time! And still trying to perform well on private leaderboard of @trolando, so I switch back to Python a lot :sweat_smile:

## Run solutions

To reliably run the solutions, `git clone` this repo. Otherwise, you can download the directory with the language(s) you need and the `input` directory, which contains my inputs from questions. Make sure that the `input` directory is at the same level as the laguage folders, like in the repo. Feel free to swap out the inputs ofc.

### Python

I guess just launch python (version 3.9 is what I use) with the file that you want, like this:

```sh
$ python python/1.py
```

### Rust

    I have yet to figure this one out...
